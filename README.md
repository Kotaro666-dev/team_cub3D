# How it works

Warinig: Our cub3D is designed to work only in Linux.

1. Type ```make``` on the directory where you can see Makefile.
2. Type ```./cub3D review/game_mode.cub``` to start game.
3. Type ```./cub3D review/save_mode.cub --save``` to save the first rendered image. The file of this image will be named `cub3D.bmp`.

Do you want to play more? Join in 42Tokyo and create your own cub3D! ;)
